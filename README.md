# PHP__Weather__App
A simple weather app using php and Bootstrap for the front end.

That project was created as part of an exercise while I was learning the basics of PHP. 
I created it using PHP, and Bootstrap to retrieve a weather forecast for a given location from weather-forecast.com. 

It shows a 1-3 day forecast, followed by a 4-7 day forecast and a 7-10 day forecast
which are displayed in three consecutive sections plus local time for the requested city.
